1. Resting BP
Resting Blood Pressure refers to the arterial pressure when a person is at rest.
RestingBP = 0 → Impossible (a living person can’t have 0 mmHg blood pressure).
→  Treat as invalid or irrelevant and should be removed or replaced.

RestingBP < 40 → Almost impossible unless device error or data entry mistake.
→ Usually treated as outlier or invalid.

RestingBP > 250 → Clinically extremely rare, likely measurement or data error.

SO I DEFINE THE RESTING BP AS RESTING BP < 40 AND RESTING BP > 250 ARE CONSIDERED AS OUTLIER

2. Cholesterol
Cholesterol column typically refers to serum cholesterol in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).
Cholesterol = 0 → ❌ Impossible (no living person can have 0 mg/dL cholesterol).
→ Invalid or irrelevant

Cholesterol < 100 → ⚠️ Unrealistically low in most adults; likely incorrect or device error.
→ Usually considered outlier

Cholesterol > 400–500 → ⚠️ Extremely rare; could happen in severe familial hypercholesterolemia, but generally not in population data.
→ Often treated as outlier

If Cholesterol < 100 or Cholesterol > 400 → treated as outlier

3. Max HR
MaxHR (Maximum Heart Rate) = The highest heart rate (in beats per minute) achieved by the person during exercise or testing.
It reflects cardiovascular fitness and heart function.

“The MaxHR column contains values between 60 and 202, which fall within the normal physiological range (60–220 bpm). Hence, no outlier treatment is required for this feature.”


4. Old Peak
Domain Understanding

ST depression values are numeric and non-negative.

Typical values range between 0.0 and around 6.0 mm.

In clinical practice:

Oldpeak = 0.0 → No depression (normal)

1.0–2.0 mm → Mild depression

>2.0 mm → Significant abnormality

>6.0 mm → Extremely rare, often a measurement or data error

If Oldpeak < 0 or Oldpeak > 6 → Outlier/Invalid





# Heart Failure Prediction
# Problem Statement :
# With a plethora of medical data available and the rise of Data Science, a host of startups are taking up the challenge of attempting to create indicators
# for the forseen diseases that might be contracted! Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million 
# lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs. People with cardiovascular disease or who are 
# at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) 
# need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help. In this way, we try to solve automate another problem that occurs in 
# the nature with a view to counter it and focus on to the next problem with the help of AI techniques!

# Aim :
# To classify / predict whether a patient is prone to heart failure depending on multiple attributes.
# It is a binary classification with multiple numerical and categorical features.

# Age : age of the patient [years]
# Sex : sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
# ChestPainType : chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
# RestingBP : resting blood pressure [mm Hg]
# Cholesterol : serum cholesterol [mm/dl]
# FastingBS : fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
# RestingECG : resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]
# MaxHR : maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]
# ExerciseAngina : exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
# Oldpeak : oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]
# ST_Slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
# HeartDisease : output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]



# Chest Pain Type
    # 1. ASY (Asymptomatic) - No chest pain is reported. silent disease
    # 2. NAP (Non-Anginal Pain) - Chest pain is present  , but it's clearly not related to the heart.
    # 3. ATA (Atypical angina) - Chest pain symptoms are present but donot perfectly fit the classic descriptions of heart-related pain
    # 4. Typical ANgina  - Classic , textbook chest pain caused by reduced blood
# ExerciseAngina  -discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle
    # Yes - String predictor of heart
# FastingBS - A value > 120 mg/dl is a indicator of high diabetes or pre-diabeted, which significantly increases heart disease risk
