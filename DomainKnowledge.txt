1. Resting BP
Resting Blood Pressure refers to the arterial pressure when a person is at rest.
RestingBP = 0 → Impossible (a living person can’t have 0 mmHg blood pressure).
→  Treat as invalid or irrelevant and should be removed or replaced.

RestingBP < 40 → Almost impossible unless device error or data entry mistake.
→ Usually treated as outlier or invalid.

RestingBP > 250 → Clinically extremely rare, likely measurement or data error.

SO I DEFINE THE RESTING BP AS RESTING BP < 40 AND RESTING BP > 250 ARE CONSIDERED AS OUTLIER

2. Cholesterol
Cholesterol column typically refers to serum cholesterol in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).
Cholesterol = 0 → ❌ Impossible (no living person can have 0 mg/dL cholesterol).
→ Invalid or irrelevant

Cholesterol < 100 → ⚠️ Unrealistically low in most adults; likely incorrect or device error.
→ Usually considered outlier

Cholesterol > 400–500 → ⚠️ Extremely rare; could happen in severe familial hypercholesterolemia, but generally not in population data.
→ Often treated as outlier

If Cholesterol < 100 or Cholesterol > 400 → treated as outlier

3. Max HR
MaxHR (Maximum Heart Rate) = The highest heart rate (in beats per minute) achieved by the person during exercise or testing.
It reflects cardiovascular fitness and heart function.

“The MaxHR column contains values between 60 and 202, which fall within the normal physiological range (60–220 bpm). Hence, no outlier treatment is required for this feature.”


4. Old Peak
Domain Understanding

ST depression values are numeric and non-negative.

Typical values range between 0.0 and around 6.0 mm.

In clinical practice:

Oldpeak = 0.0 → No depression (normal)

1.0–2.0 mm → Mild depression

>2.0 mm → Significant abnormality

>6.0 mm → Extremely rare, often a measurement or data error

If Oldpeak < 0 or Oldpeak > 6 → Outlier/Invalid
